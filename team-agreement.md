### Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Communication is key. Attempt to handle any and all issues at the lowest level possible. If this doesn’t work, we will escalate it to Michelle.

Address it with the person in question, and discuss it as a group. We all want to succeed!

4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

Communicate any and all issues as a group, remembering nothing is personal, it is for the betterment of the team.

After addressing it at the lowest level possible, if unsuccessful we will escalate and involve our instructor.

By working in pairs, or via mob programming and remaining in constant communication with each other.

Add teammates as collaborators or create organization

3. What is your Git flow?

One person owns repo, and code has to be approved by two or more members. Make a dev branch and make dev default to protect the main branch. Everyone works off dev branch, and work on features then PR.

4. Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

   1. How many people must review a PR?

   Two team members.

   2. Who merges PRs?
